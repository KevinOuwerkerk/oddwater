\description{
A multivariate dataset containing the variables obtained using water quality
sensors from Sandy Creek. The characteristics of the different types of anomalies
are presented in detail in Leigh, et al. (2019). The anomaly types can be further
grouped into three general classes. Class 1 included anomalies described by a
sudden change in value from the previous observation (types A, D, I, and J).
Class 2 included those anomaly types that should be detectable by simple,
hard-coded classification rules, such as measurements outside the detectable
range of the sensor (types F, G and K).
Class 3 anomalies may require user intervention post hoc (i.e. after data
collection rather than in real time) to confirm observations as anomalous
or otherwise in combination with automated detection (types B, C, E, H and L).
